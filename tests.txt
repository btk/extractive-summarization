1 On 18 November 2005 I published reasons for judgment in this proceeding; see Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing & Allied Services Union of Australia v ACI Operations Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1662.
These reasons for judgment should be read together with the reasons for judgment published on 18 November 2005.
12 Given that Mr Williams has been reinstated and that ACI has been admonished for its conduct in the 18 November 2005 judgment, there are no continuing consequences in respect of ACI's conduct.
Counsel for the Union informed the Court that ACI has, since 18 November 2005, agreed to make adjustments necessary to ensure Mr Williams' financial position is restored.
10 I now turn to the other factors relevant to the question of penalty as discussed by Branson J in Construction, Forestry, Mining & Energy Union v Coal & Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) (1999) 94 IR 231, as foreshadowed at [79] in the previous judgment.

1 The appellant is a Coptic Christian lawyer, who is a citizen of Egypt.
The Tribunal rejected the appellant's claim that Coptic Christian lawyers were a particular social group in Egypt.
The Tribunal's decision

5 The Tribunal accepted that the appellant is an Egyptian national and is a Coptic Christian.
14 The Federal Magistrate rejected the appellant's first submission, noting that the Tribunal did not regard Coptic Christian lawyers as a particular social group and referring to the Tribunal's finding that the appellant's problems emerged as a result of the religious focus of his political activities and its findings about the circumstances surrounding the appellant's detention and alleged attempted torture.
First, it was submitted, the Tribunal erred in failing to address the appellant's claims, in particular of persecution for his membership of the Liberal Party, for his membership of the particular social group made up of Coptic Christian lawyers and for his alleged apostasy.

HIS HONOUR:

1 This is an appeal from a decision of a Federal Magistrate, delivered on 15 July 2005.
The Federal Magistrate's decision

28 His Honour accepted (at [23]) that the appellant's claim was not frivolous:

'the sur place claim made on behalf of the [appellant] could not have been dismissed as trivial.
34 The appellant submitted that the learned Federal Magistrate erred in finding no jurisdictional error in the Tribunal's decision.
An application was filed in this Court on the appellant's behalf, seeking review of that decision, was transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court, and was ultimately dismissed there.
An appeal to the Full Court was subsequently dismissed.
